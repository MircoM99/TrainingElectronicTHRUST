# Training STM32
In this directory there are all the materials necessary to learn the STM32 microcontroller.
You can find Reference and Overview documents which explain the structure of the uC and the HAL_Library.pdf which explain the HAL functions
useful to program the uC.


## Source code
In each directory is present the project for the STM32CubeIDE presented during the training lessons:

## Lesson 1
In the first lessn we take a look at the STM32 IDE enviroments and we develop togheter a simple software which convert 4 channel when the external
button is pressed. The conversion data will be sent to the USART and visualized on Putty.
