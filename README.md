# Training for the new member of the electronic team

In this repository there are all the material for the trainging of the new member of the electronic team of THRUST.

## First part
In the firts part we will talk about analog eletronic and how we use it. So we will talk about OpAmp, INA and conditioning circuits. We will see how to use temperature sensors, pressure sensors and load cell.
After that we will see a brief overview on the power electronic part inside our electronic, so we will about MOSFET and Boost Converter.

You can find some useful references inside the AnalogElectronic directory.

## Second part
In the second part of the training we will see the microcontroller STM32 and how to use it.
First of all you need to dowloand and install it from ST:
 - https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html
After that we will see how to use: GPIO, Interrupt, Timers, DMA, ADC and USART.

You can find some useful references inside the uC directory.

At the end of the course there will be a small exam.
