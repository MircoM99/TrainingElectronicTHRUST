# Training for the new member of the electronic team

In this repository there are all the material for the trainging of the new member of the electronic team of THRUST.

## First part
In the firts part we will talk about analog eletronic and how we use it. So we will talk about OpAmp, INA and conditioning circuits. We will see how to use temperature sensors, pressure sensors and load cell.
After that we will see a brief overview on the power electronic part inside our electronic, so we will talk about MOSFET and Boost Converter.

You can find some useful references inside the AnalogElectronic directory.

## Second part
In the second part of the training we will see the microcontroller STM32 and how to use it.
First of all you need to dowloand and install it the IDE from ST:

After that we will see how to use: GPIO, Interrupt, Timers, DMA, ADC and USART.

You can find some useful references inside the uC directory.

At the end of the course there will be a small exam.

## Safety courses
In order to garantee the acess of the THRUST Laboratory for the next future you should attend some Safety courses mandatory for the 
university of Padova.

You should do the general training 4h (italian or english language as you prefer):
